    <h1>home Page</h1>
    <p>A home page is generally the main page a visitor navigating to a website from a web search engine will see, and it may
        also serve as a landing page to attract visitors.[1][2] The home page is used to facilitate navigation to other pages
        on the site by providing links to prioritized and recent articles and pages, and possibly a search box.[3] For example,
        a news website may present headlines and first paragraphs of top stories, with links to full articles, in a dynamic
        web page that reflects the popularity and recentness of stories.[4] Meanwhile, other websites utilize the homepage
        to attract users to create an account. Once they are logged in, the homepage may be redirected to their profile page.
        This may in turn be referred to as the "personal home page".[5] A website may have multiple home pages, although
        most have one.[6] Wikipedia, for example, has a home page at wikipedia.org, as well as language-specific home pages,
        such as en.wikipedia.org and de.wikipedia.org.
